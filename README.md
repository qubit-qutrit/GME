The main file for the OO-invariant two-qutrit state is given by the "OO_Invariant_States_and_the_Multiplicative_Property" notebook.
The two notebooks needed to compile everything in this file are given by the "OO_Invariant_State_Global_Objective_Function_for_Complex_Optimization" and "OO_Invariant_State_Global_Objective_Function_for_Real_Optimization"
The associated graphs are found in the "OO_symmetric_real_graph" and "OO_symmetric_complex_graph" png files.

The main file for the singlet mixture two-qutrit state is given by the "Singlet_Mixtures_and_the_Multiplicative_Property" notebook.
The two notebooks needed to compile everything in this file are given by the "Singlet_Mixture_Global_Objective_Function_for_Complex_Optimization" and "Singlet_Mixture_Global_Objective_Function_for_Real_Optimization"
The associated graph is found in the "Singlet_mixture_real_and_complex_graph" png file.
